I have also had it with fresh pork strings. Glorious. Do you have any idea what it is or a recipe??? I have been unable to find it anywhere in my Chinese library.

You can use snapper, dory, kingklip or hake. I like to cut away the belly because its alot thinner in thickness. Cut the steak portion into large chunks. They will shrink when cooked, so dont cut too small a piece. I dont waste the belly parts. I like to roll them up. And then tie the roll of belly fish meat with a single strand of chive, so that it will look as chunky as the rest of the fish meat. Set aside the prepared fish. Prepare the red capsicum. Slice off one end. And then slice off the other end. This will give you a tube. Slide a knife around the inside walls of the red capsicum. Remove the inner seeds and membrane. Slice the hollow tube of red capsicum into half and then slice into thin strips. Grate or mince some peeled ginger to get approximately 1 tablespoon of ginger. Prepare a handful of spices/herbs  2 stalks of lemon grass, 10 lime leaves and a handful of curry leaves. Add 2 tablespoons of cooking oil to a pan. When the oil is hot, add 3 tablespoons of red curry paste of your choice. I always use the A1 brand from Singapore. Find a good curry paste that works for you where you are, and then stock your larder with it! Stir fry the paste in the hot pan for a minute. Add the ginger. Add the garlic. Stir fry well to combine. Add the lemon grass, lime leaves and curry leaves. Stir well to combine. Add 1 tablespoon of tamarind paste. Stir well to combine and dissolve the tamarind. When the curry paste is nice and fragrant, about 1 to 2 mins later, add 3 tablespoons of Shaoxing Huatiao wine. Add 400ml of coconut cream. Every brand of coconut cream is different. Some are thicker than others. But dont add water at this point. And dont use coconut milk instead of cream or light coconut milk. Its not the same. Add 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce. Add 1 tablespoon of sugar. Stir well to combine and leave to simmer on a low heat. The sauce will get very thick. Dont add water here because when the fish is placed in to cook, it will introduce alot of moisture to the sauce. When the sauce has been simmering gently for 2 to 3 mins, taste the sauce. Adjust the taste here because every brand of oyster sauce/tamarind/wine is different and the sauce needs to be fine tuned accordingly. If its too sour, add a little more sugar. If it tastes flat, add a little wine and oyster sauce. Stir well to combine. When the sauce is ready, gently add the fish into the pan. Keep the stove at medium heat and let the fish cook slowly in the sauce. Try not to handle the fish too much in the sauce as it will cause the fish to flake or break up. As the fish cooks, it will release moisture into the sauce and thin it out. Gently cover the fish with the sauce. Cover the pan and let it simmer till the fish is cooked through. It usually takes about 5 to 8 minutes depending on the thickness of the fish. When the fish is cooked, add the red capsicum strips and gently stir through till they are warmed through but not cooked till soft. If the sauce is too thick at this point, add a couple of tablespoons of water and stir well to combine. Dish out the fish curry gently because the fish may flake or break up. Garnish with coriander leaves.","lunch, main course, main dish, dinner",https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/632983-312x231.jpg,45,6,https://www.foodista.com/recipe/CMGXWKB8/assam-fish-curry,"Indian, Asian",lunch,"Indian, Asian"

Optional: Cooking each ingredient separately (pepper, carrot / garlic, onion / shrimp) to ensure that they cook consistently is perfectly fine, but it will add another 5~10 minutes to your cooking time. In another pan or skillet, scramble 2 eggs in generous amount of oil. When finished, add eggs to the main skillet with other ingredients. Optional: Prepare 4 sunny-side up eggs for the topping/garnish. On low heat, add cooled rice, butter, soy sauce and oyster sauce and mix thoroughly with spoon (wooden works best). Make sure to coat sauce on rice and rest of ingredients well; this will take a few minutes and some hand/wrist strength from continuous mixing. Plate the fried rice topped with a sunny-side up egg. If wanting a semi-round shape (see pic above), stuff fried rice in a round bowl pressing down firmly. Set the bowl upside down on a plate; the fried rice should sit upright in a round shape. Enjoy with kimchi and other banchan (side dishes). *Some people like to stir fry the ingredients separately because they cook at different times.

My folks originated from this area of the sub-continet and hence this was popular at home.

Put the chops, tomatoes, onions, cayenne pepper, yoghurt, salt and ginger-garlic paste into a large wok or heavy-bottomed saucepan. Stir and bring to the boil.

Add the garam masala and lemon juice and stir. Sprinkle fresh coriander over the top and serve.TIPSIn the Punjab, tomatoes are grated to make a puree - don't be tempted to use ready-prepared tomato puree instead of fresh.The spice combinations in garam masala vary in different parts of India. In the Punjab this one which you can try making yourself is common: 5 tbsps coriander seeds, 3 tbsps cumin seeds, 2 1/2 tbsps black peppercorns, 2 1/2 black cardamom seeds, 2 in cinnamon stick, 4-5 cloves, 1/6 nutmeg. Put the coriander and the cumin into a cast-iron frying-pan over a medium heat.Stir until lightly roasted. Allow to cool. Grind with the remaining ingredients in a clean coffee grinder and store in a tightly lidded jar.This rich flavoursome dish originates in the fertile Punjab, a state now divided between India and Pakistan. There is nothing more important to a Punjabi man's diet than bread, and meals are accompanied by flat round cornbread rotis or rich, flaky pan-fried paratha layered with ghee(clarified butter).Rice is reserved for special occasions or for rice pudding, for the only food that makes a Punjabi feel he has eaten a proper meal is his bread!

Next, add the minced garlic, curry paste, diced potatoes, chopped carrots, and stir everything together. Add the vegetable stock and cover the pot with a lid. Once the stock starts boiling, add the coconut milk, cabbage, and chopped summer squash, stir, and wait for the water to start boiling again. Once the stew boils, season with fish sauce, lime juice, and sea salt. Check to see if the potatoes are fully cooked by piercing a fork into a piece of potato. If the fork can go through it easily, they're ready.Turn off the heat, and add the chopped basil. You can also save some for garnish.In a bowl, put about 1 to 1-1/2 cups of the vegetable noodles on the bottom, and pour the stew on top.

About 1 inch by 1 inch. Place the meat in a bowl. Add 1 egg white. Then add 1 tablespoon of corn flour. And add 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper. I use Masterfoods Garlic Pepper Seasonings whenever salt and pepper is required. A generous shake of this to get about 1/2 teaspoon will do. Mix it all well with your fingers. Set aside till ready to use. Peel and cut a large onion into bite size pieces, approximately the same size as the chicken. Do the same for the cucumber. But keep the skin on the cucumber. Drain a can of lychees. Reserve the juice. Add 4 tablespoons of cooking oil in a hot pan. Keep the heat at medium high at all times. When the pan is hot. Add the chicken and make sure they are evenly distributed on one side on the pan. Let the chicken cook. It will eventually turn golden brown. When that happens, turn it around and cook the other side. Once the chicken is golden brown on both sides, dish them out of the pan and set aside in a warm place. Pour away excess oil in the pan and reserve about 1 tablespoon of oil. Return the pan to the stove and add the onions. Stir fry for a minute. Add 1 tablespoon of minced garlic. Stir fry till garlic is slightly toasted and fragrant. Add the cucumbers. Keep stir frying for another 30 seconds. Add the drained lychees. Mix well. Add 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce. Add 1 tablespoon of ketchup. Add 1 tablespoon of Shaoxing Huatiao cooking wine. Add 1 teaspoon of sugar. Add 2 tablespoons of the reserved lychee juice from the can. If the pan looks very dry, add 1 to 2 more tablespoons of the juice. Do not make too much sauce. We want the sauce to gently coat the meat and not drown the meat in it. Stir well to combine. Add a pinch of salt and pepper or 1/4 teaspoon of Masterfoods Garlic Pepper Seasonings. At this point, taste the sauce and adjust sweetness-sour levels accordingly. If too sweet, add a little more ketchup. If too sour, add more sugar. If not salty enough, add more salt+pepper.

Dip a fingertip into the bowl of water and trace along the two edges farthest from you. Bring up the end closest to you, fold over the filling, and pinch the edges together to seal. Make sure youve gently pressed the wrapper around the filling so there are no air pockets. Stand up your little triangle pocket so that the filling side sits on your work surface. Fold the top point down, away from you, and pinch. Now, give the edges on either side of that fold 2 little pleats and pinch. Your pot sticker will now look like it has wings. Place it on a large plate thats been dusted with a bit of cornstarch, to prevent sticking.

Lay beef skewers over heat and stay nearby to monitor.Once bottom is a little charred, brush the tops with canola oil, and flip. Brush again with thickened teriyaki sauce.Once the bottoms are slightly charred again, be careful not to overcook, flip and brush with thickened teriyaki sauce, so both sides are sauced. Remove and garnish with toasted sesame seeds. Serve with rice.","lunch, main course, main dish, dinner",https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/1096283-312x231.jpg,100,4,https://www.foodista.com/recipe/GZX7TFZQ/thinly-sliced-beef-yakitori,"Asian, Japanese",lunch,"Asian, Japanese"

Cut the butter into the flour until you have small crumbs. Add enough of the water to form a smooth dough. It will be rather sticky.Dust your hands with flour and divide the dough into two even balls. Roll out each ball of dough on a floured surface. You should aim for a rectangle that is about 1/8 inch thick. Using a sharp knife, slice the dough into squares. Put your squares on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and put them in the freezer for about 15 minutes. Remove from freezer and use a fork to prick the crackers. You want a few rows on each cracker and really press so that you go all the way through. Sprinkle with coarse salt if desired. Bake for 20-25 minutes at 325 until the edges are golden brown. Remove from oven and cool.How many crackers you get will depend on the thickness of your dough. You should easily get at least 5 dozen.The serving size here is for 10 crackers if you made a batch of 60.","antipasti, starter, snack, appetizer, antipasto, hor d'oeuvre",https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/1426917-312x231.jpg,45,6,https://spoonacular.com/site-1586184583744,"Indian, Asian",antipasti,"Indian, Asian"

1697543,Ground Pork Ramen,"ramen, vegetable oil, ground pork, celery, garlic, oyster sauce, soy sauce, chili paste, cilantro, lime wedges",548.25,33.65,10.96,47.52,"While you’re chopping your veggies and collecting the other ingredients, cook ramen noodles (without using the seasoning packet). Before you drain them, scoop out about half a cup of the water and set aside. This liquid will become part of the sauce.  Drain the noodles and rinse in cold water, so they’ll stop cooking. Cooked ramen should be springy but not spongy.  Heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil over high heat in a sauté pan and brown the ground pork. Use a wooden spoon to break apart any clumps. Do not season the meat with salt and pepper.  Cook the pork until it’s browned or even let it cook until it’s crisp, your preference.  After about 8 minutes, the pork should have nicely browned and can be removed from the pan.  Add another tablespoon of vegetable oil to the same pan and sauté the celery and/or any other vegetable you’re using for about two minutes. Add garlic for another 30 seconds.  Add reserved pasta water to the pan and stir in three tablespoons of oyster and soy sauce each.  Use a wooden spoon to scrape off the burnt pork bits (the best stuff) from the bottom of the pan.  Add the pork back into the pan and then add the noodles. Finally, add some heat like hot sauce, chili paste, sriracha, hot pepper flakes, etc, and mix everything well.  Sprinkle with some chopped cilantro, garnish with lime wedges, and serve. I love to squeeze some lime juice over everything. It gives the dish a light, refreshing touch that mingles nicely with the spiciness and the umami flavor provided by the oyster and soy sauces. ","lunch, main course, main dish, dinner",https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/1697543-312x231.jpg,20,4,https://maplewoodroad.com/ground-pork-ramen/,"Asian, Japanese",lunch,"Asian, Japanese"

Let the meat cool a couple minutes. Combine the meat with the sauce and give it good stir.  Taste it.  Now is a good time to add some Maldon salt to brighten up the flavors a bit. Serve over cooked rice, top with remaining scallions, mint, and cilantro, and serve with an ice cold beer (a Corona Extra works excellent).","lunch, main course, main dish, dinner",https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/1697723-312x231.jpg,30,2,https://maplewoodroad.com/thai-street-food/,"Thai, Asian",lunch,"Thai, Asian"
1697815,Easy Naan Bread with Garlic Butter,"warm water, granulated sugar, active yeast, flour, yogurt, salt, olive oil, egg, butter, garlic, torn into pieces",256.41,12.02,5.49,31.3,"In a small bowl, mix together warm water, sugar, and yeast, and stir well with a spoon. Then let it sit for about 5 minutes or so, until it becomes foamy. Using a Kitchen Aid stand mixer with a dough hook attachment, add all ingredients (including the yeast mixture) to the bowl. Mix all ingredients together until the dough is soft, smooth, and pulls away from the side of the bowl. Remove dough from the bowl and knead by hand for about 1 minute and form into a ball shape.  Grease a large bowl with olive oil. Place the ball of dough into this greased bowl and roll it around so that all sides are coated. Cover and place in a warm location for about 1 hour, or until dough has doubled in size. Once the dough has doubled in size, remove it from the bowl and cut into 8 equal-sized pieces.  Ok, real quick, let’s make the garlic butter. This will only take 3 minutes! Over low heat, in a cast iron skillet, melt 5 Tbsp butter. Once the butter has melted, add the minced garlic and saute for about 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Then, immediately remove the pan from the heat and pour the butter/garlic mixture through a sieve into a bowl, so separate the garlic from the butter. Alternatively, if you want to leave the garlic pieces in there for a bit of an extra bite on top of your bread, go right ahead! Alright, back to the naan bread! Now crank up that same cast iron skillet up to medium-high heat…you want it quite hot! Lightly dust your working surface with flour (not too much!) and roll out each piece to about 1/8″ thin. It’s important to roll out the dough immediately before cooking, or it may not develop those characteristic bubbles while cooking. Once the skillet is hot, place one of the rolled out dough pieces into the pan. You should see bubbles forming pretty quickly…this is definitely a good thing!After about 1 minute, using a spatula, take a peek on the bottom side of the bread. If it’s browning, flip it over and cook for another 1 minute. Repeat the above step for all 8 pieces of rolled-out dough. Finally, remove your cooked naan bread from the skillet and brush with garlic butter, then top with your favorite herbs. Serve warm and enjoy!","fingerfood, antipasti, bread, starter, snack, appetizer, antipasto, hor d'oeuvre",https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/1697815-312x231.jpg,70,8,https://maplewoodroad.com/easy-naan-bread-recipe/,"Indian, Asian",fingerfood,"Indian, Asian"
